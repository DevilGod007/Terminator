# Chess Game with Lc0 and PyQt

This project is a chess game built with Python using PyQt for the GUI and Lc0 (Leela Chess Zero) as the AI engine. The game also includes AI logic implemented in Python and supports game storage in `.pgn` format for training a neural network model (`.h5`).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (recommended version: 3.8 or higher).

### Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Game

1. Run the `menu_gui.py` script:
   ```bash
   python menu_gui.py
   ```
2. Click on the **Setup** button to generate the neural network file for the engine.
3. Click **Start** to launch the game.

## Features
- Play chess with a graphical interface using PyQt.
- AI opponent powered by Lc0 (Leela Chess Zero).
- Supports move validation, checkmate detection, and castling.
- Stores completed games in `.pgn` format.
- Uses `.pgn` files to train a neural network (`.h5`) for improved AI performance.

## File Structure
- `menu_gui.py` - Main script to launch the GUI.
- `requirements.txt` - Contains all dependencies required to run the project.
- `train/` - Directory where `.pgn` files are stored after each game.
